<h1> The Software </h1> <h3> The greatest thing about building your own 
arcade cabinet is you can put whatever game you want on it.  You can find 
online "roms" for nearly every arcade game ever made and play them using a 
program called an "emulator".  I used the emulators "MAME" and "DAPHNE" to 
play the 80 or so games installed in my cabinet.  I used a windows 
machine, but both have MAC support.  See the "links" section for more 
details. <BR> <BR> Since the machine can play so many games, it seemed 
like a good idea to put in a menu system so you could choose which game to 
play using the controllers.  I used a program called "Glaunch". <br><br> 
<img src="screenshot.jpg"> <br><br> A nice thing about GLaunch is that you 
can choose an image to be displayed in the background when you highlight a 
game.  Also you can give it a list of mp3s to play while the menu is 
running.
